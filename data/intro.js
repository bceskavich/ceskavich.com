  'I am a software engineer. I currently work for [Vox Media](https://product.voxmedia.com/pages/our-team), \
  where I’ve been gainfully employed for over 2 years. At Vox I work on the \
  publishing team, which means I touch all the parts of our proprietary CMS \
  Chorus. I spend the vast majority of my days writing JavaScript and Node code. \
  I also regularly push Ruby code to our slew of Rails applications. I’m \
  currently trying to learn Rust.',
