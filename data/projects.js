    'I wrote a theme for VSCode called [Dracula at Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bceskavich.theme-dracula-at-night). It’s a fork of [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/), but with higher contrast and less (i.e. no) italics. I’m thinking of making an even higher contrast version soon.',
    'I built a Slackbot called [Shitty Bot](https://glitch.com/~shitty-bot), which always replies with an @channel. It started as an inside joke, it ended as an excuse to work with Glitch for the first time. Conclusion: Glitch is great! I will use it again.',
    'I’m trying (for the second time) to learn Rust by going through the second edition of [_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/foreword.html). I think I’m going to put it to use to toy around with image processing and manipulation. The catalyst here were a number of talks at [DinosaurJS 2018](https://dinosaurjs.org/) highlighting Rust’s investment in WebAssembly as a first-class target of the Rust compiler. WebAssembly seems cool, Rust seems cool, and I want to learn more about both!',
    'I’ve written a couple small apps in Elixir over the past two years. The most substantial of these projects was a never-quite-production-ready Slack notification service, which consumed events from Kafka and outputted Slack pings. I would still say I’m learning the ins and outs of OTP and the actor model of concurrency.'

    'I built a Jackbox.tv-inspired party game called [U Don’t Know Me!](https://github.com/udontknowmeapp/udontknowme) at a hackathon in 2015. I kept hacking on the project afterwards as a way to learn more about React, Redux, and real-time web apps. Fun fact, [Fibbage 3](https://jackboxgames.com/project/jbpp4/) uses the same gaming premise (guessing things about your friends) and was released 2 years after our prescient hackathon project.',
    'I did a lot of random data visualization work in school. It was one of the first ways I really started to learn programming. My favorite project from that time was an interactive map of drought trends in the mainland United States, which I creatively called [Drought in America](https://github.com/bceskavich/us-drought).'
